# simple-dao	[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/thiaguten/simple-dao.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/thiaguten/simple-dao)
simple-dao is an dao design pattern API that greatly facilitates the exchange and use of multiple persistence providers.

In test package was implemented two examples using the simple-dao API. A demonstration where transactions are manually controlled (beginTransaction, commitTransaction, rollbackTransaction...) and another using the SpringFramework (@Transacional).
