# simple-dao [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/thiaguten/simple-dao.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/thiaguten/simple-dao)
simple-dao is an DAO design pattern API that greatly facilitates the exchange and use of multiple persistence providers (JPA, Hibernate) in the same project.

In test package was implemented two examples using the simple-dao API. A demonstration where transactions are manually controlled (beginTransaction, commitTransaction, rollbackTransaction...) and another using the SpringFramework (@Transacional).
